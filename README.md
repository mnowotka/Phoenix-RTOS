# Phoenix-RTOS
This is GPL-licensed prototype version of Phoenix-RTOS developed in 2001 by Paweł Pisarczyk

Some information about Phoenix-RTOS can be found in this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix-RTOS.

The current version of Phoenix-RTOS is proprietary but early versions were GPL licensed. Since they are not longer accesible via http://www.phoesys.com/ website I've decided to save version 1.1 for the future and put it here.

Please note this code was originaly created by Paweł Pisarczyk.
